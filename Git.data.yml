
-> Git version: 2.10 , latest version: 2.34.0

Difference Between GitLab and GitHub:
--> GitLab is open-source for community edition. GitHub is not open source.
--> The core difference is GitLab has Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and DevOps workflows built-in.
--> GitHub lets you work with the CI/CD tools of your choice, but you'll need to integrate them yourself. 

-> Git is an open source, distributed version control system (VCS). 
-> It's commonly used for source code management (SCM).
-> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle projects with speed and efficiency.

GitHub : It is a web-based Git repository hosting service. 
         GitHub offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (S.C.M.) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

. Git - Git is system for version control primarily used by programmers and others who writs code.
      - It runs at the command line on your local machine.
	    - It allows you to keep track of your files and modifications to those files in something called a repository (repo).
	    - To track last five changes to the rep :#git log -5 
	    - you can use it with a team of people who are working on the same project.
	    - It's useful in team env because everyone can work independently on those files.
	  
 . Git Hub - Git HUb is website that allows you to upload your Git repositories online.
           - It gives GUI for navigating your repos.
		       - It gives other peoples navigate your repos.
		       - Finally it makes repo collaboration easy.
		  
 . Then configure Git with the new user as follows:
  #git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	#git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

 . Now verify Git configuration using following command:
    #git config --list 
	
 . #git init is used to start using git on a project.
   -> git init initialises (i.e. creates) a repository. 
   -> Each project should be in its own repository.
   -> If you downloaded your project using git clone then you don't need to run git init again.
 . -> Each project has one .git folder in the project's root directory and that is the project's repository.
 
##### what is .GIT ? ############################################################################
   -> The .git folder contains all the information that is necessary for your project in version control and all the information about commits, remote repository address etc. 
   -> All are present in this folder. 
   -> It also contains a log which stores your commit history so that you can roll back to history.
   -> This is one of the reasons git is so fast compared to svn or cvs 
    - The entire repository is processed on the local hard disk without any network traffic.
   
   
   
-> git add:   adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not committed
   git commit: commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log... 
               If you do not add any files, git will not commit anything. You can combine both actions with #git commit -a
   git push :  pushes your changes to the remote repository.
   
################ git - remote add origin vs remote set-url origin #################
   
-> #git remote add origin <remote repository URL> --> It is used to a add a new remote.
   Ex: #git remote add origin https://github.com/demodevops2/ganeshrepo.git --> https protocal.
       #git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git --> ssh protocal.
     
-> #git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git --> It is used to change the url of an existing remote repository.
   Ex: #git remote set-url origin git@github.com:demodevops2/ganeshrepo.git
       #git remote -v ---> List of existing remotes

-> git remote add => ADDS a new remote.
   git remote set-url => UPDATES existing remote.
   
-> #git add --> selects changes
   #git commit --> records changes LOCALLY
   #git push --> shares changes to remote origin.
   
-> git fetch: is the command that says "bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date." 
              git fetch grab changes from remote repository and puts it in your repository's object database.
   #git log master..origin/master --> To check remote origin updates.
   #git merge origin/master --> To update local repository to workstation.
   git pull: says "bring the changes in the remote repository where I keep my own code."

############################ Git commands ###############################

-> lists branches merged into master: #git branch --merged master
-> lists branches merged into HEAD: #git branch --merged
-> lists branches that have not been merged: #git branch --no-merged
-> By default this applies to only the local branches. 
    -> -a flag will show both local and remote branches, and the -r flag shows only the remote branches.
-> you can delete it locally: #git branch -d mybranch
-> To check the branchs list :#git branch -va


############################################################################################################################
Branch: Allows to working with the different versions of the same file as parallel. 
        Branch's are independed we have create diff branches like dev and prod to work on diff versions.

#git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph : To check the head pointer.
#alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph" : To create alias

#cat ~/.gitconfig --> if you want to add permanently follow below steps:
# git config --global alias.gklogs 'log --all --decorate --oneline --graph'

-> Every commit has a 40-Hex decimal she-1 hash.
   At the time of logs checking it's Shows only first 7 characters of hash.
-> #git merge --abort -> Again we started with clean working tree and staging area, 
                         we can do this(if any case we can't reslove merge confilts by using abort cmd to recovery previous stage)

HEAD:  is a ref (reference point) to the currently checked out commit.some times call symbolic pointer HEAD tell out terminal what we have checkout.

Merge: 
Fast-Forward-merge: Move branch directly to the master branch.
3-way merge: not a direct path to merge master branch to merge branch.

#git diff master..SDN : To check the two branchs diff

#git branch --merged : Before delete the SDN(branch)merge to check which branch is merged to which one.

#######################################################################################################################

-> To create branch #git branch <branchname>
-> Enter branch : #git checkout <branchname>
-> Back to master branch : #git checkout master  --> checkout is used to switch b/w the diff branches.
-> merge the master branch: #git merge newbranch
-> To push the update data to repo: #git push origin master
-> To delete local branch : #git branch -d <branchname>
-> Check list of branches :#git branch
-> pull the updated data : git pull http link.
-> create and enter new branch : git checkout -b branchname
-> To update current branch to master : git rebase master
-> add the remote origin : git remote add origin link.
-> add new remote branch: #git push origin <branch name >

Git checkout : It is remove all your local changes whatever you done.
               Repacle server version with your local and whatever changes you have done it will completely removed.
               you can not do undo operation once if you issue this cmd.
               Git checkout can undo unstaged changes by pulling the previous commit's version of a file from repository's history.

-> Github allows you to:  . share your repositories with others.
                          . Access other user's repositories.
                          . Store remote copies of your repositories (github servers) as backup of your local copies.
						              . GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
						  
####################################  Rebase   ###################################################################
-> Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch into another. 
-> Where they differ is how it's done. Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. 
-> Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.



-> Rebase : As an alternative to merging, you can rebase the feature branch onto master branch using the following commands:
            #git checkout feature
            #git rebase master
			The major benefit of rebasing is that you get a much cleaner project history. 
			First, it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by git merge.
			Second, rebasing also results in a perfectly linear project history.

-> Git reset: Practically, you can think of it as a "rollback" it points your local environment back to a previous commit. 
              By "local environment," we mean your local repository, staging area, and working directory.

-> git revert: command is similar to reset, but its approach is different. 
               Where the reset command moves the branch pointer back in the chain (typically) to "undo" changes, 
               the revert command adds a new commit at the end of the chain to "cancel" changes.

############################################### Restore a deleted file ###########################################

-> If the deletion has not been committed, the command below will restore the deleted file in the working tree?
#git checkout -- <filename>

-> You can get a list of all the deleted files in the working tree using the command below
#git ls-files --deleted

-> If the deletion has been committed, find the commit where it happened, then recover the file from this commit?

#git checkout <commit log path>^ -- <filename>

-> In case you are looking for the path of the file to recover, the following command will display a summary of all deleted files?(deletion has been committed).
#git log --diff-filter=D --summary

#####################  Restore a Deleted Branch in Git  ###########################

-> Yes, you should be able to do git reflog and find the SHA1 for the commit at the tip of your deleted branch, then just git checkout [sha].
-> 1. If you just deleted the branch, you'll see something like this in your terminal:
    #Deleted branch <your-branch> (was <sha>)
	  #git checkout 28fdd37
	  #git checkout -b <branchname>
-> 2. To restore the branch, use: 
      #git checkout -b <branch> <sha>
-> 3. Find the 'sha' for the commit at the tip of your deleted branch using: 
      #git reflog
	  
-> check with hash commit log using #git reflog 
                                    #git checkout <Hashlog>
									                  #git branch -b <deleted branch name> --> to recovery deleted branch.
									

############ Delete remote branch origin ########################

#git push origin --delete <branch name>

############# Cloning specific branch ############################

#git clone <url of repo> -b <branch name to be cloned>

Ref link my self: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ZYkjOWr6g

Diff b/w branch and tag? : 
-> Branchs move along with commits while tags are just stable points of a code base.
-> tags don't move long with the commits. Creating specific points in history for your data.

# git checkout <branch> --> check out branch 
# git tag <tagname> --> create tag on specific point in history(v1.0)
# git tag -a v1.1 -m "tag for release ver 1.1" --> create annotated tags. 
# git show v1.0 --> display v1.0 info 
# git tag -l "v1.*" --> display start with v1.
# git push origin v1.0 --> push tags to remote repo 
# git push --tags --> to push all the tags at once.
# git tag -d v1.0 --> to delete tags from local
# git push origin -d v1.0 --> to delete tags from remote 
We can not checkout tags in git, We can create a branch from a tag and checkout the branch.
# git checkout -b branchname tagname 
Can i create a tag from some past commit ?
# git tag tagname <ref of the commit>

############### How do I undo the most recent commits in Git? #####

############ Fork a repo #######################################

-> A fork is a copy of a repository. 
-> Some one else can contribute in your project.
-> Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Most commonly, forks are used to : 

-> Propose changes to someone else's project
A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.
4. If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

-> Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.
